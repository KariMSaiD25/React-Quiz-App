Before you can run this project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** (preferably the latest LTS version)
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)** (Node package manager, usually comes with Node.js)

## Getting Started

1. Open a terminal (CMD, PowerShell, or terminal of your choice).

2. In the project root directory, run the following command to start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run server
3. Open another terminal window and start the React development server by running:
